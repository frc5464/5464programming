# Welcome to the FIRST Team 5464 Github! 
## We are Bluejacket Robotics, a program that encompasses FRC & FTC teams.

###Here you can find our team's robot code, as well as other software projects we work on outside of the main robot.

- In the FIRST Robotics spirit of Teamwork, the Bluejackets would like to help others get started with programming.
  It's often one of the biggest barriers keeping many teams from getting up and running.
  So take a look around the repositories!
