# Welcome to the Bluejacket Robotics Github! 
## Bluejacket Robotics is a program that encompasses FRC & FTC teams in Cambridge/Isanti, Minnesota, USA.
### First Robotics Competition team:
- 5464 - Bluejacket Robotics
### First Technical Challenge teams:
- 23815 - Blue Krakens
- 24534 - Blue Hydras
- 24535 - Blue Megalodons

## Here you can find the robot code for our bots, as well as other software projects we work on outside of the main robot.

- In the FIRST Robotics spirit of Teamwork, the Bluejackets would like to help others get started with programming.
  It's often one of the biggest barriers keeping many teams from getting up and running.
  So take a look around the repositories!
